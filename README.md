The task is to automatically compute mathematical functions from the images provided using machine learning algorithms.
Unlike the classical MNIST dataset, here the problem goes one step further where along with 2 digits there is also a letter denoting an addition or multiplication operation, all in the same image. The algorithm has to return the result of this operation. Three approaches have been used to implement this problem: a baseline logistic regression learner, a fully-connected feedforward neural network and convolutional neural networks.
